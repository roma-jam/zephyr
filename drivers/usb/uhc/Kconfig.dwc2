    config UHC_DWC2_PORT_DEBOUNCE_DELAY_MS
        int "Debounce delay in ms"
        default 250
        help
            On connection of a USB device, the USB 2.0 specification requires
            a "debounce interval with a minimum duration of 100ms" to allow the connection to stabilize
            (see USB 2.0 chapter 7.1.7.3 for more details).
            During the debounce interval, no new connection/disconnection events are registered.

            The default value is set to 250 ms to be safe.

    config UHC_DWC2_PORT_RESET_HOLD_MS
        int "Reset hold in ms"
        default 30
        help
            The reset signaling can be generated on any Hub or Host Controller port by request from
            the USB System Software. The USB 2.0 specification requires that "the reset signaling must
            be driven for a minimum of 10ms" (see USB 2.0 chapter 7.1.7.5 for more details).
            After the reset, the hub port will transition to the Enabled state (refer to Section 11.5).

            The default value is set to 30 ms to be safe.

    config UHC_DWC2_PORT_RESET_RECOVERY_MS
        int "Reset recovery delay in ms"
        default 30
        help
            After a port stops driving the reset signal, the USB 2.0 specification requires that
            the "USB System Software guarantees a minimum of 10 ms for reset recovery" before the
            attached device is expected to respond to data transfers (see USB 2.0 chapter 7.1.7.3 for
            more details).
            The device may ignore any data transfers during the recovery interval.

            The default value is set to 30 ms to be safe.
